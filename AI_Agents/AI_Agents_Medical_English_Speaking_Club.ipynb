            "The debate about genome editing is not a new one but has regained attention following the discovery that CRISPR has the potential to make such editing more accurate and even \"easy\" in comparison to older technologies.  Bioethicists and researchers generally believe that human genome editing for reproductive purposes should not be attempted at this time, but that studies that would make gene therapy safe and effective should continue.1,2 Most stakeholders agree that it is important to have continuing public deliberation and debate to allow the public to decide whether or not germline editing should be permissible. As of 2014, there were about 40 countries that discouraged or banned research on germline editing, including 15 nations in Western Europe, because of ethical and safety concerns.3 There is also an international effort led by the US, UK, and China to harmonize regulation of the application of genome editing technologies. This effort officially launched in December 2015 with the International Summit on Human Gene Editing in Washington, DC. For more information on this summit, see What's happening right now?  NHGRI uses the term \"genome editing\" to describe techniques used to modify DNA in the genome. Other groups also use the term \"gene editing.\" In general, these terms are used interchangeably.  Ethical Considerations Safety Due to the possibility of off-target effects (edits in the wrong place) and mosaicism (when some cells carry the edit but others do not), safety is of primary concern. Researchers and ethicists who have written and spoken about genome editing, such as those present at the International Summit on Human Gene Editing, generally agree that until germline genome editing is deemed safe through research, it should not be used for clinical reproductive purposes; the risk cannot be justified by the potential benefit. Some researchers argue that there may never be a time when genome editing in embryos will offer a benefit greater than that of existing technologies, such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and in-vitro fertilization (IVF).4  However, scientists and bioethicists acknowledge that in some cases, germline editing can address needs not met by PGD. This includes when both prospective parents are homozygous for a disease-causing variant (they both have two copies of the variant, so all of their children would be expected to have the disease); cases of polygenic disorders, which are influenced by more than one gene; and for families who object to some elements of the PGD process.5,6  Some researchers and bioethicists are concerned that any genome editing, even for therapeutic uses, will start us on a slippery slope to using it for non-therapeutic and enhancement purposes, which many view as controversial. Others argue that genome editing, once proved safe and effective, should be allowed to cure genetic disease (and indeed, that it is a moral imperative).6 They believe that concerns about enhancement should be managed through policy and regulation.  Lastly, commenters on the issue are concerned that the use of genome editing for reproductive purposes will be regulated differently inside and outside of the U.S., leading to uses considered objectionable to the American public. These arguments cite the largely self-regulated environments of the reproductive clinics that offer PGD and IVF7,8 and the existing differences in regulations among different countries.9  Informed Consent Some people worry that it is impossible to obtain informed consent for germline therapy because the patients affected by the edits are the embryo and future generations. The counterargument is that parents already make many decisions that affect their future children, including similarly complicated decisions such as PGD with IVF. Researchers and bioethicists also worry about the possibility of obtaining truly informed consent from prospective parents as long as the risks of germline therapy are unknown.10  Justice and Equity As with many new technologies, there is concern that genome editing will only be accessible to the wealthy and will increase existing disparities in access to health care and other interventions. Some worry that taken to its extreme, germline editing could create classes of individuals defined by the quality of their engineered genome.  Genome-Editing Research Involving Embryos Many people have moral and religious objections to the use of human embryos for research. Federal funds cannot be used for any research that creates or destroys embryos. In addition, NIH does not fund any use of gene editing in human embryos. (See: U.S. and NIH regulations and perspective)  While NIH will not fund gene editing in human embryos at this time, many bioethical and research groups believe that research using gene editing in embryos is important for myriad reasons, including to address scientific questions about human biology, as long as it is not used for reproductive purposes at this time.11,12 Some countries have already allowed genome-editing research on nonviable embryos (those that could not result in a live birth), and others have approved genome-editing research studies with viable embryos.13,14 In general, research that is conducted in embryos could use viable or nonviable embryos leftover from IVF, or embryos created expressly for research. Each case has its own moral considerations.\n",

Emily has a family history of cystic fibrosis (CF); her younger brother was diagnosed with the condition at birth and has had a challenging life due to recurrent pulmonary infections and pancreatic insufficiency. Emily is a known carrier of the ΔF508 mutation, the most common mutation associated with CF. Tom has no known family history of genetic disorders, but both partners are concerned about the risk of passing CF to their offspring. They are considering in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and are interested in the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the embryo's genome to eliminate the CF risk entirely.\n",

            "Article: The debate about genome editing is not a new one but has regained attention following the discovery that CRISPR has the potential to make such editing more accurate and even \"easy\" in comparison to older technologies.  Bioethicists and researchers generally believe that human genome editing for reproductive purposes should not be attempted at this time, but that studies that would make gene therapy safe and effective should continue.1,2 Most stakeholders agree that it is important to have continuing public deliberation and debate to allow the public to decide whether or not germline editing should be permissible. As of 2014, there were about 40 countries that discouraged or banned research on germline editing, including 15 nations in Western Europe, because of ethical and safety concerns.3 There is also an international effort led by the US, UK, and China to harmonize regulation of the application of genome editing technologies. This effort officially launched in December 2015 with the...\n",

            "**Patient History:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The patient, a 30-year-old woman named Emily, presents to the genetic counseling clinic with her partner, Tom. Both are planning to conceive their first child. Emily has a family history of cystic fibrosis (CF); her younger brother was diagnosed with the condition at birth and has had a challenging life due to recurrent pulmonary infections and pancreatic insufficiency. Emily is a known carrier of the ΔF508 mutation, the most common mutation associated with CF. Tom has no known family history of genetic disorders, but both partners are concerned about the risk of passing CF to their offspring. They are considering in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) and are interested in the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the embryo's genome to eliminate the CF risk entirely.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Presenting Symptoms:**\n",
            "\n",
            "This case does not involve physical symptoms in the traditional sense, as it concerns prospective parents seeking advice on genetic editing. The primary \"symptom\" is the risk of genetic transmission of CF to their future child.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Physical Examination Findings:**\n",
            "\n",
            "As the case is centered around genetic counseling and ethical considerations of genetic editing in embryos, no physical examination findings are relevant for Emily and Tom. Both individuals are healthy adults with no apparent physical health issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Laboratory/Imaging Results:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Genetic Testing: Confirmed Emily as a carrier of the ΔF508 mutation. Tom underwent genetic screening and was found to be a carrier as well, presenting a 25% risk of having a child affected by CF with each pregnancy.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. IVF and PGD: If pursued, would involve the development of embryos in vitro, followed by genetic testing to identify embryos free from the ΔF508 mutation.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Potential CRISPR-Cas9 Application: Theoretical modeling would suggest the possibility to edit the CFTR gene in embryos to prevent CF. However, the clinical safety and long-term effects of such interventions are not yet fully understood.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Diagnosis:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The primary concern is reproductive risk for cystic fibrosis due to both parents being carriers of the ΔF508 mutation. The ethical dilemma arises from the potential use of genetic editing technologies to prevent transmission.\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **IVF with PGD**: Discuss this as a viable option to select embryos that do not carry the CF mutation, thereby eliminating the risk of CF in their child without altering the genome.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **CRISPR-Cas9 Consideration**: Present the theoretical possibility of using CRISPR-Cas9 for gene editing, but emphasize the current experimental status of this technology, ethical considerations, and unknowns regarding long-term effects and potential off-target impacts.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Ethical Discussion**: Engage in a thorough discussion about the ethical implications of genetic editing in embryos, touching upon issues such as potential unintended consequences, societal implications, and the moral status of editing human embryos.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Multidisciplinary Consultation**: Recommend a consultation with an ethics board and possibly legal experts to fully understand the ramifications of choosing gene editing, if pursued.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Decision Making**: Encourage Emily and Tom to take time to consider all information, ensuring their decision aligns with their values and understanding of the risks involved.\n",
